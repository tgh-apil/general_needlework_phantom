# General Needlework Phantom

A general needlework training phantom, created using 3D printing and ballistics gel molding for the purpose of simulating ultrasound-guided needle insertion. See how-to-use guide and assembly instructions below.

This model was developed at the [Lynn & Arnold Irwin Advanced Perioperative Imaging Lab](https://apil.ca/), Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network.

> Fully assembled phantom and case.

## How-to-Use Guide
To prepare for use, first fill the tubes with water by opening the valves on both ends and using a syringe to inject water, then closing both valves.

The phantom can now be used for ultrasound imaging. The water-filled tubes should be visible under ultrasound, mimicking veins, and should contrast with the graphite-filled gel surrounding them (see image below). The user can practice using ultrasound imaging to locate a patient’s vein, into which they can then insert a needle.

## Assembly Instructions
### Mold
1. 3D print out the intermediate mold components using any rigid filament. Clamp them together and cast with silicone.
2. Laser cut the wooden pieces. Initially there are enough holes cut for 2 veins, however extra vein holes can be drilled if desired.
3. Attach the bottom wooden component to the bottom of the silicone component with 4 screws.
4. Attach the corner components to the long wooden side components with screws, then screw that to the sides of the silicone mold. Then screw the corner components into the bottom of the silicone mold.
5. Slide the shorter side components into the gaps between the corner pieces and the silicone mold, and screw into place.

### Case
1. Print both components.
2. Insert a rubber bumper into each hole.

### Phantom
1. Cut silicone tubing and insert across the mold through each set of holes in the wood. Leave enough tubing outside the holes to be able to insert tube couplings later on.

2. Melt ballistics gel (here, a roughly 2:1 mixture of [20% ballistics gel](https://www.clearballistics.com/shop/20-ballistic-gelatin-nato-block-16x6x6/) and [Humimic Medical Ballistics Gel #4](https://humimic.com/product/gelatin-4-medical-gel-by-the-pound/) was used) and stir in graphite powder until uniformly distributed and nearly opaque. (The precise amount of graphite powder is not important so long as it produces a distinct contrast under ultrasound.)
3. Pour roughly 600g of gel into mold, or until the gel is nearly flush with the top of the mold.
4. Once cooled, remove from mold by unscrewing the corner components and pulling the mold apart until the phantom and the wood pieces can be removed. Then pull the wood pieces off of the tubes. If there are any pockets or uneven areas on the surface of the phantom that are interfering with ultrasound visibility, use a heat gun to melt the surface until these areas smoothen out.
5. Insert a tube coupling into each end of each tube. Attach a valve to each coupling.
6. Place phantom inside the case, with the tubes sticking out at either end, and screw the lid in place with four M3 screws.
